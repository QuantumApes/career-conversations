My name is Georgi Dimitrov. I just graduated from Vanderbilt University in December 2025 with my Bachelor of Science in two majors: Economics and Molecular and Cellular Biology. I am particularly fascinated by agentic AI and its endless capabilities. I am also passionate about philosophy—authors like Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and Machiavelli. I have a Samoyed dog named Ayra and love playing with her. Finally, I like building and designing things—I recently built her an automatic dog feeder with a sensor.
